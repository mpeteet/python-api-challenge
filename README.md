# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?
#
# Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. This assignment seeks to show through data analysis, that the weather does indeed get hotter as we approach the equator. 
#
# Part I - WeatherPy is a script that visualizes the wether of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 
#  Through a series of scatter plots the following relationships are showcased:
# - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
# - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
# - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
# - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
#
# A linear regression is run on each relationship. Plots are separated into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degress latitude):
# - Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
# - Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
# - Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
# - Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
# - Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
# - Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
# - Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
# - Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# Part I Outcomes and Observations:

# Part II - VacationPy uses juypter-gmaps and the Google Places API to plan future vacations
# A heat map displaying humidity for every city in Part I will be created
# To find an ideal weather condition the following three conditions would exist:
# - A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70
# - Wind speed less than 10 mph
# - Zero cloudiness
# Cities not meeting the criteria above will be dropped.
# Google Places API is used to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of the coordinates. The hotels will be plotted on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing Hotel Name, City and Country.
